RegularExpression - it is used to valid our email, password, phone numbers etc.
TypeScript does not have a regular expression type we use 'any' type to define a regular expression
 any //    
 string match(^w{4,10}/) - The match method takes a regular expression and checks in the given string
 matching the regular expression, it does return a true, if does'nt return a false value
 Regular expression is a combination of meta characters and quantifiers
 Meta characters - 
  1)  ?  zero or one character
  2) + for one or more occerance of given character
  3) * for zero or more occerance character of a given character 
  4) \w - alpha numeric value
  5) \d - all the digits or numbers
  6) \s - spaces if we want to use
  7) [A-z] - all the capital letters
  8) [a-z] - same for lower case
  9) [0-9] - checks the numeric values
  10) \^ - a particular string starts with and $ for ends with
  11) (?=.*[A-B]) - Atleast one occerance of the, altleast on capital letters
  12) (?=.*[!@&^%$]) - Atleast one special character

Quantifiers:
  1) {n} - How many number should occurc, Exactly n number of characters should occur
  2) {m,n} - Min of m and Max of n
  3) {m,} - it is a Min m and MAx of any
