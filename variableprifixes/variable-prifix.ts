//const - once we define a variable with the const prifix it should not be changed, In word of java it 
//the final keyword.
var pi = 3.12;
pi = 6.67;//able to change the value
//where in const we can't able to change the value ex: This is the read-only property
const pii = 3.14;
pii = 8.89 //got error
//once we execute this program with const error, it's not showing error, Because it introduce on ES6 feature
//it just showing a warning not give a COMPILATION ERROR

//When we using const in function

//declare - it is used to define variables of ambient type or scope
