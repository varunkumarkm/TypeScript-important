what is type script?
-> TypeScript is super set of javaScript or J++(TypeSafe, and easy)
Advantages:
* All the typeScript code is trance compiled into a javaScript by using a typeScript compiler
* Easy of use
* Help us to Oops: Interface, Inheritance, Encapsulation 
* In typeScript defining the variable is ex: var x: number = 10;

How to install a TypeScript
-> NPM - Node package manager, same as we javaScript using node-js and npm
-> Step1 - using command prompt check our node and npm versions 
-> step2 - npm install -g typescript
once sucessfully install, check the version using tsc --v (typeScript compiler)

1) Variable and Data types:
Variables we using typeScript are: var and let
 var x = 123;
 let x = 'varun';
 var x = 3.14
 Defining this variable we using Data types

 typeScript Data types are:
 * Number   * String   * Boolean  * any   * Enum   

 finally we defining the: 
 var x:number = 10; Number can stores the integer and any decimal values
 var s:string = 'varun'; String is stores a string values
 var b:boolean = true; Boolean can stores the either true or false
 var a:any = "varun" can stores the any data type values, It can hold any type of data at any time
 var e = {Male,Female} Enum is a sequence of a constanr value

 Note: variables.ts - This is the file name once I run this command tsc variables.js it will converted 
       into javaScript and new file also automatically converted

 Note: when I use the console.log, console is a inbuilt object and log is a function of an inbuilt object
      once its execute showing into browser or console, 
      Similarly we have alert, confirm and prompt
      alert - it is display to a proper message to the end user
      confirm - display the message and ask the end user confirm a particular action
      prompt - display a pop-up box and promps the user from enter from information

Enum - Enum is a collection of constant values

2) operators:
* Arithmatic * Comparision, * Logical * Ternary

3) Flow control statements: 
* if-else, * switch, * break, * while loop

4) Objects and arrays
syntax of object is:
var product = {
    id:123,
    name:varun,
    city:mysore
}
for the typeScript for creating a objects we can using a Interface and classes also
4) Functions
5) Arrow Functions
6) Variable prifixes
* var * const * let * declare
*let - let is a block scoped variable, once we used let its available only that block and not outside of it
let is supports with after ES6 features
*var - where as when we declare a var, it will available for the entire function
